# Copilot Instructions

Guidance on tone:

- Avoid apologizing or making conciliatory statements.
- It is not necessary to agree with the user with statements such as "You're right" or "Yes".
- Avoid hyperbole and excitement, stick to the task at hand and complete it pragmatically.
- You do not need to be so verbose when telling me what you are going to do.
- You do not need to then tell me what you just did.

Guidance on changes:

- Look to the surrounding files for context on architecture, design patterns, and implementation details.
- Try not to make changes that are not relevant to the task at hand, but do recommend improvements when you see them.
- Ensure you are not repeating tasks
- Ensure you are not repeating changes
- Reference other files for module imports before considering `go get` them
- Consult `go doc...` if you encounter undefined types or functions
- Ensure your changes compile by running `go run ./cmd/atmunge`.
- After compiling works, run command(s) to test changes.

## Instructions for subdividing the problem

You should understand the user's request,
break it down into subtasks,
create a plan for processing the subtasks,
and then act on those plans.
Sometimes the task to break down is itself a subtask.

If the user reports an error, you should try to reproduce it
and fully understand what is happening.

Spend time thinking.

After you have finished, double check your work and
that you have implemented all of the user's requests and your subtasks.
Also ensure you did not deleted any important code or functionality.
